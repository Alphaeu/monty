The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Monty byte code files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension.
Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account:
The monty program

Usage: monty file
where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message USAGE: monty file, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message Error: Can't open file <file>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where <file> is the name of the file
If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number where the instruction appears.
Line numbers always start at 1
The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
it executed properly every line of the file
it finds an error in the file
an error occured
If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message Error: malloc failed, followed by a new line, and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
You have to use malloc and free and are not allowed to use any other function from man malloc (realloc, calloc, …)
The push opcode

The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.

Usage: push <int>
where <int> is an integer
if <int> is not an integer or if there is no argument given to push, print the error message L<line_number>: usage: push integer, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number in the file
You won’t have to deal with overflows. Use the atoi function
The pall opcode

The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

Usage pall
Format: see example
If the stack is empty, don’t print anything

The pint opcode

The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pint
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

The pop opcode

The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

Usage: pop
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pop an empty stack, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

The swap opcode

The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

Usage: swap
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't swap, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

The add opcode

The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

Usage: add
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't add, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter

The nop opcode

The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.

Usage: nop

The sub opcode

The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.

Usage: sub
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't sub, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter

The div opcode

The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

Usage: div
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't div, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter
If the top element of the stack is 0, print the error message L<line_number>: division by zero, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

The mul opcode

The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.

Usage: mul
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't mul, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter

The mod opcode

The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

Usage: mod
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't mod, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter
If the top element of the stack is 0, print the error message L<line_number>: division by zero, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

The stack opcode

The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). This is the default behavior of the program.

Usage: stack
The queue opcode

The opcode queue sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO).

Usage: queue
When switching mode:

The top of the stack becomes the front of the queue
The front of the queue becomes the top of the stack

The pchar opcode

The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pchar
The integer stored at the top of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
If the value is not in the ascii table (man ascii) print the error message L<line_number>: can't pchar, value out of range, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pchar, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

The pstr opcode

The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pstr
The integer stored in each element of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
The string stops when either:
the stack is over
the value of the element is 0
the value of the element is not in the ascii table
If the stack is empty, print only a new line

The rotl opcode

The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.

Usage: rotl
The top element of the stack becomes the last one, and the second top element of the stack becomes the first one
rotl never fails
The rotr opcode

The opcode rotr rotates the stack to the bottom.

Usage: rotr
The last element of the stack becomes the top element of the stack
rotr never fails
